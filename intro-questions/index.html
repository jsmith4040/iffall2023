    <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>My name is Jeanette Smith. I am a senior in Olin majoring in finance.</li>
        <li>I am pursuing minors in computer science and human-computer interaction so I am taking interaction foundations to fulfill requirements for those minors and learn more about web development!</li>
        <li>I have some experience in HTML, CSS, and JS because I took CSE 330. However, I took it my sophomore year so I am hoping this class will help me refresh my knowledge.</li>
        <li>I am hoping to learn how to optimize a user's experience on a webpage, whether that is through aesthetics or functionality.</li>
        <li>I think designing for a screen is different than designing for paper because rather than seeing the visual product as you are creating, you have to maintain a vision in your mind as you are writing code to match that vision.</li>
        <li>I think <a href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=%5BBrand%20Text%5D%20-%20UO%20-%20Trademark%20-%20HGK&utm_content=UO%20-%20Trademark&utm_term=urban%20outfitters&creative=654055373431&device=c&matchtype=e&network=g&utm_kxconfid=vx6q4l3b6&gclid=Cj0KCQjwusunBhCYARIsAFBsUP_wVxepLTTnvv97yJNPQOkOJv-ycDi5LNzwKTluby3iEia4_U90sLsaAkRvEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Urban Outfitters</a> exemplifies effective design because of the categorical organization. User's can easily navigate the webpage based on their individual shopping needs (i.e. navigating to "Women's">"Jackets" if they are looking to buy a new jacket).</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/">Wall Street Journal</a> exemplifies effective communication. The page conveys a lot of useful information to the viewer through the grid-style design, concise headers that stand out, photographs, article preview text, and additional info like the reading time.</li>
        <li><a href="https://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> is a website that works very well in my opinion. It's biggest value driver is how intuitive it is to use. As soon as a user navigates to this site, they will quickly be able to figure out how to add an event to the calendar, navigate to a different week or month, and edit existing events.</li>
