            <h3>Recipe Page</h3>
            <p>I designed my recipe page with the intention of portraying a rather simple lasagna recipe as something that is modern, chic, and high-end. I chose to use dark-tinted imagery and deep basil green accents on a clean white background to bring this design concept to life. In terms of user experience, I used my own experience with recipe pages to inform my decision to include a "jump to recipe" button, as I am often thankful when I find recipe pages with this functionality.</p>

            <h3>Microsite - Designer/Developer</h3>
            <p>I worked under the creative direction of Jaime Hebel as I built out this microsite on the US Women's Gymnastics Team during the Summer 2021 Olympics. Jaime's vision was to present an image-centric, informational site that gave context on each gymnast as an individual. She also wanted me to utilize some of the design themes used on the Team USA and Olympics websites. I really enjoyed the process of collaborating with Jaime and she gave me a lot of initial creative freedom during the mock-up stage and then gave me more specific feedback as I iterated.</p>

            <h3>Microsite - Creative Director</h3>
            <p>I have never done a project in which I held the role of creative director before so this was definitely a learning experience for me! As I wrote the creative brief, I had a conceptual vision for this site - I wanted the homepage to have a historic, vintage tone while each season page was an immersive experience with vibrant colors and imagery. Once I found out that Amelia Johnson would be building the site, I explained this vision to her and provided sample color palettes and images, but also gave her the opportunity to put her own personal spin on the concept. I love what she did with the site, especially her image treatment with the polaroid styling and asymmetric positioning.</p>
